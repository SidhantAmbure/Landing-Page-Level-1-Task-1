# Landing-Page-Level-1-Task-1
This HTML code creates a basic landing page for an "International Travel Agency" called "World-Tour." It includes a header section with a navigation bar containing links for Home, Hill Stations, Best Offers, and Contact Us. There's also a "Register" button.

The header has a background image and a central section for the agency's name and a catchy phrase with a call-to-action button to book a trip.

The CSS styles set the layout, colors, fonts, and effects like hover animations for the navigation links and the "Register" button. It also positions elements and adjusts their sizes for a visually appealing design.
